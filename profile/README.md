# This is UFUG 2601 C++ Programming at HKUST(GZ)!

This course covers programming and data structures using C++. In addition to basic programming concepts such as variables, arrays, pointers, and functions, students will learn about the standard data structures in C++, such as vectors, sets, maps, and queues. This course will also introduce the basics of object-oriented programming and some useful algorithms in the standard C++ libraries. Weekly laboratory experiments will provide hands-on experience in programming.

## Assessments:

- Lab exercises: 20%
  - Finish exercise in the weekly lab
- Programming assignments: 50%
  - Four programming assignments
- Midterm exam: 15%
  - Cover materials from Week 1 - Week 7
- Final exam: 15%
  - Comprehensive exam
